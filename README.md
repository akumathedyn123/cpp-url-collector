## C++ Web Crawler - Download and Extract Links

This C++ program crawls websites, downloads their HTML content, extracts links, and saves them to separate files.

### Features

* Reads URLs from a text file.
* Downloads HTML content using libcurl.
* Parses HTML using libxml2.
* Extracts links from the parsed HTML.
* Saves extracted links to separate files named after the original URL.
* Removes processed URLs from the input file.

### Requirements

* C++ compiler
* libcurl ([https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/workflow-downloading-files-curl](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/workflow-downloading-files-curl))
* libxml2 ([https://dev.w3.org/XML/doc/xml.html](https://dev.w3.org/XML/doc/xml.html))

### Usage

1. Build the program using your preferred C++ compiler.
2. Create a text file named `urls.txt` containing one URL per line.
3. Create an output directory (e.g., `/path/to/output`).
4. Run the program, specifying the output directory:

```bash
./program_name /path/to/output
```

**Note:** Replace `program_name` with the actual executable name of your compiled program.

### Output

The program will download the HTML content of each URL in the input file. It will then extract links from the downloaded HTML and save them to separate files in the specified output directory. The filenames will be formatted as `URLs_<page_name>_<original_url>.txt`, where `<page_name>` is extracted from the URL and `<original_url>` is the original URL from the input file. The program will also remove processed URLs from the input file.
